# about_me

I like to solve tough problems. I want to work on challenging projects that make a difference for others, surrounded by people smarter than me who inspire me. I love to build things that work, complex things designed with simplicity and elegance.

I believe it's our job as developers to produce real and measurable results for business owners, while also leaving a codebase for fellow and future developers that is clean, maintainable, and extensible. There is nothing more important to the health of a codebase than clean code/ clean architecture, but it means nothing if it doesn't produce real value for the customer right now.

I am guided by a lifelong curiosity and tireless desire to be better today than yesterday, better tomorrow than today.
