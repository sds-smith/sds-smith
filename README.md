# about_me

Hi, my name is Shawn.

After working most of my adult life in the restaurant industry, in 2021 I decided a career change was in order. With the support of my wife and family, I set myself down the path toward a career in Web and Mobile Development.

From my experience as a multi-unit restaurant leader, I bring soft skills like strong communication, collaboration, relationship-building, partnering and mentoring.  I bring over a decade of experience iterating, prototyping, and scaling an ever-changing operational model.

From my ongoing studies in Web and Mobile Development, I have attained valuable technical skills, including:

* Architecting scalable, performant web apps with React.js
* State management with Redux (including thunk, saga, and persist)
* Mobile Apps with React Native and Expo
* Responsive Web Design with Semantic HTML5 and CSS3
* CSS-in-JS
* Interactive Web Development with Javascript
* Web APIs and Asynchronous Request Handling
* Version control with Git and GitHub
* oAuth 2.0 Authentication
* Node.js
* Express.js


I recently attained a score of 725 on the General Coding Assessment administered by CodeSignal (815 on the practice test), earned a Certified Level 3 score on the Triplebyte React assessment, and completed Codecademy’s Front End Engineer certification.  

I’m driven by the desire to be better today than yesterday, better tomorrow than today, and by the belief that the moment we stop learning, we stop living.
