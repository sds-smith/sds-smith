# about_me

Hi, my name is Shawn.

After working most of my adult life in the restaurant industry, in 2021 I decided a career change was in order. With the support of my wife and family, I set myself down the path toward a career in Web and Mobile Development.

From my experience as a multi-unit restaurant leader, I bring soft skills like strong communication, collaboration, relationship-building, partnering and mentoring.  I bring over a decade of experience iterating, prototyping, and scaling an ever-changing operational model.

From my ongoing studies in Web and Mobile Development, I have attained valuable technical skills, including:

* Responsive Web Design
* Dynamic Web Development and asynchronous logic
* Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures
* Object-oriented and Functional Programming
* TypeScript
* Front-end Development Libraries
  ** React.js
  ** React Native
  ** Vue.js
* Single-page Web Apps
* Mobile Apps
* Web Accessibility
* Web APIs
* oAuth 2.0 Authentication
* Search Engine Optimization
* node.js
* express.js

I recently attained a score of 725 on the General Coding Assessment administered by CodeSignal (815 on the practice test), and completed the Front End Engineer certification from Codecademy.

Iâ€™m driven by the desire to be better today than yesterday, better tomorrow than today, and by the belief that the moment we stop learning, we stop living.
