# about_me

Hi, my name is Shawn.

After working most of my adult life in the hospitality industry, in 2021 I decided a career change was in order. With the support of my wife and family, I set myself down the path toward a career in Web and Mobile Development.

From my experience as a multi-unit restaurant leader, I bring soft skills like strong communication, collaboration, relationship-building, partnering and mentoring.  I bring over a decade of experience iterating, prototyping, and scaling an ever-changing operational model.

From my experience as a Developer, I bring valuable technical skills, including:

* Architecting scalable, performant web apps with React.js
* Server side rendering and static site generation with Next.js
* Creating reusable, extensible components
* Writing clean, maintainable, quality code
* State management with Redux and asynchronous Redux
* The latest versions of JavaScript and TypeScript
* Consuming REST API data with Asynchronous JavaScript
* Architecting MVC REST APIs with Node.js and Express.js
* Architecting MVC GraphQL APIs with Apollo Server
* Consuming GraphQL with Apollo Client
* Version control with Git and GitHub
* Containerizing full-stack applications with Docker
* Cloud hosting with AWS Cloudfront, EC2, and S3 buckets
* Responsive design with CSS-in-JS, SCSS, CSS3
* All stages of project lifecycle - from inception to deployment

I build robust, scalable, enterprise-level apps with the full capability of React 18, Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, and other tools within the MERN ecosystem like Next.js, Docker, AWS, React Router, Redux, GraphQL, Firebase, Stripe, Jest and React Testing Library, and CSS-in-JS.

I have earned a Certified Level 4 on the Triplebyte React assessment and attained a score of 725 on the CodeSignal General Coding Assessment.

Iâ€™m driven by the desire to be better today than yesterday, better tomorrow than today, and by the belief that the moment we stop learning, we stop living.
