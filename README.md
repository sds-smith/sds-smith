# about_me

Hi, my name is Shawn.

After working most of my adult life in the restaurant industry, in 2021 I decided a career change was in order. With the support of my wife and family, I set myself down the path toward certification in Web Development.

From my experience as a multi-unit restaurant leader, I bring soft skills like strong communication, collaboration, and relationship-building.

From my ongoing studies in Web Development, I have attained valuable technical skills, including:

 * Responsive Web Design
 * Dynamic Web Development and asynchronous coding
 * Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures
 * Front End Development Libraries
     - React.js - functional and class components, hooks, custom hooks, React router
     - Vue.js
 * Single-page Web Apps
 * Web Accessibility
 * Web APIs
 * oAuth 2.0 Authentication
 * Search Engine Optimization
